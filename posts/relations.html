        <h1>Bitcoin and Human Relations</h1>
        <p>
            I've been thinking about this for a long time: as a Bitcoin
            maximalist, does Bitcoin help me overcome my problems with people,
            and if so, how?
        </p>
        <p>
            I've had some breakups that have helped clarify my thoughts on this.
            The day before I wrote this article, I parted ways with a person I
            really loved, and I've ended long-lasting friendships before, but
            the last one was a literally “relationship”, so I feel qualified to
            give my opinion on the matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            First of all, if you're a Bitcoin maximalist, you have a low time
            preference and you value your time, because stacking sats is like
            planting time, you're saving your time to find better returns later.
            Being so time-oriented, you also have a huge number of principles.
            That's why you start to be incredibly selective about the people you
            let into your life. Based on what we have mentioned so far, you
            might think that the breakups experienced by this limited circle can
            cause you more damage. Let's say that as a man I have my family, a
            few close friends and a woman in my life. When I lose a woman, I
            lose 100% of the women in my life, when I lose a close friend, I
            lose 1/3 of my close friends. So why is it that these breakups don't
            affect me as much as they affect people with high time preferences?
            After all, they have insubstantial relationships, they should be
            less affected by their losses. But this is not how it is, and this
            is the part that surprises me.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you build a family, a business, a career, a personality on
            Bitcoin, the impact on your life of having built it on Bitcoin is
            far greater than you can imagine. If you had built it on fiat money,
            things could go bad beyond the control of the members of the
            relationship; but when you build it on Bitcoin, things can only go
            bad because of you or the people you're associated with, so you're
            never looking for someone to blame, and the moment things go bad,
            the culprit is already revealed. At that point, because time keeps
            flowing, you always put time ahead of breakups, and it's much easier
            to get up and keep fighting than it is for people who have fallen
            into the pit of sociological corruption that fiat money brings.

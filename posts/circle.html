  <h1>Life Circle</h1>
<p>It is impossible not to see that some people are constantly throwing themselves into unnecessary rushes, shitty times, absurd decisions.</p>
<p>I have thought about these people for a long time, because I am fed up with them, and I have thought about their actions more than they do, so as not to let more of them into my life.</p>
<p>One of the first things that can be said when analyzing the actions and rhetoric of these people is “Get a job.” This is absolutely true. So why am I writing this article? The reason I cannot write this article is to justify this “Get a job.”.</p>
<p>Every human life consists of a certain amount of routine and randomness. The proportion of these “quantities” plays an important role in getting to know that person, but that is not our point right now. This routine and randomness is based on the circle of human life.</p>
<p>It is entirely up to the individual what they put in the center and orbit of the life circle, or at least it should be, that is what is ideal. People with low time preference have time at the center of their circle of life. They place people and places around this time, and invest time in the center, i.e. time, to develop the orbit. This is the opposite for people with high time preference. They put people and places at the center of their life circle, which is why they will never find peace no matter what they do. This is why people with high time preference are always lazy, unhappy and tired. Time is not at the center of their lives. Time has a beginning (birth) and an end (death) for every human being. The only thing that is always with you between this beginning and end is time, you can never be “timeless”. Therefore, when you put time at the center of your life, the center of your circle of life is always open to improvement. So what happens when you put people/places at the center of your life? When you lose them (and they are not like time, because they can leave, they can be destroyed, they can die), the center of your life is lost, you become orbitless, you don't know what to do and you start making stupid decisions. The reason why people with high time preference are always chasing instant pleasures is not because they are looking for excitement, but because they are lost.</p>
<p>The benefit of removing these lost ones from your life is that you will always be able to hold the threads of your orbit in your hands. Otherwise, these lost ones will make you the center of their lives and try to make you a lost one too. That's why these people find themselves in shitty arguments and fights. They keep bickering with the people at the center of their lives, trying to lose the peaceful so that they can continue to justify their peacelessness with the impossibility of achieving peace.</p>
<p>People with low time preference love time so much that they run harder to move the finish line forward. The peace of doing the right thing cannot be found in any wrong thing. </p>

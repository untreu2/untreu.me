# Desperate People
The negativization of loneliness, which is widely heard in society, comes from the anxiety of losing members of the herd. Unlike all these slanders, loneliness is one of the most virtuous points a person can reach.

Loneliness is not about whether there are people around you or not, it is about your resistance to those around you. Nowadays, the game of “Look good, be good, be treated well.” throws people into an endless abyss of nothingness. People are too busy pretending to be perfect to realize their own imperfections. But those who don't know their flaws don't know their needs, and those who don't know their needs don't know what to do.

What happens when you play a game where every second you have to be better than the last second as if you started the game as the best? You become the worst. You become unable to be alone with yourself and unable to stand yourself. That's why people who try to get along with everybody, who are afraid to have principles, whose opinions are as square as a circle when they have to express them, do this dickriding. These people are so desperate that they cannot stand themselves. To escape themselves they spend time with other people who are like them. They hate having their mistakes pointed out to them. Make them hate themselves, don't empathize, tell them about their mistakes and leave them alone with their crowd. Time will always declare you the winner.

The action to be taken against the helpless is clear: Become an outcast of the community without becoming an outcast of the community. The desperates are numerous, intellectually deficient, mentally dependent. The moment you try to get along with them, they will try to narrow the gap between themselves and you. So you must never fall into this situation, you must never spend any time when you are not alone with those who cannot be alone, so that you can be alone. Enjoy your independence!

One person who prefers to spend time with you to being alone is worth a thousand people who spend time with you because they cannot be alone.
